# Hip Hop Refactor
www.hiphoprefactor.com

Contributing to Hip Hop Refactor is easy and encouraged. 

### Steps:

- [Clone the repo](https://github.com/hiphoprefactor/hiphoprefactor.github.io)
- Create a new post in the `_posts` directory following the same pattern as other posts.
    - Each post requires an embedded Github Gist of your hip hop refactor, and an embedded Youtube video version of the song you are refactoring.
    - NOTE: Make sure to grab the embedded code snippets for your Gist and Youtube video.
- Submit a PR

- If you want to go the extra mile, test your changes locally first: https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll
